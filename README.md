# Bob's RepairShop
An Android application written in Java that is connected to a backend SQLite Database.

The goal of this application is to track repair information in a car repair shop. The database consists of 3 tables: one to track vehicle information, a client table and a repair table that stores information about repairs that have been completed. Below is a list of some of the things that the user can do:
  - add new client
  - add new vehicle (linked to specific client)
  - add new repair (linked to specific vehicle)
  - search repairs by keyword
  - update client information
